# Kd-Trees

## Summary

Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point). 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval. Check the programming assignment [specification](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree.html) | [local](./kdtree.html) that describes the assignment requirements.

## Testing

[Tests](../../tests/kdtree)

## Result

[Report](../../reports/kdtree_output), this is previous version which got 78/100.

## Note

Not get 100/100, only pass: 82/100, will revisit soon
